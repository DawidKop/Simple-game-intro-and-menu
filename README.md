# Simple game intro and menu
A demonstration of game intro that uses fade in & fade out technique. With constant panel size of full HD, on FHD screens it imitates fullscreen mode. On bigger screens, the panel becomes centered, undecorated. Menu allows to navigate up and down with keyboard arrows. Space and Enter buttons are used to confirm picked option. As this is only a demostration, only exit (quit) funcionality is implemented.

Built and tested with OpenJDK 11.0.3.7. Screenshot is provided below. This program is strongly influenced by the data gathered around the Internet.
